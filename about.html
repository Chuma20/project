            Three schools amalgamated in 1978 to form Adelaide Gymnasium whose pupils are nicknamed Kwaggas - the Adelaide Hoerskool, Hoer Huishoudskool(for girls only) and Piet Retief Hoer Tegniese Skool(boys only).
            The school was then called Hoerskool Piet Retief. In 1993 the name was changed to Adelaide Gymnasium, which was the original choice of the school.

    In 2008 the schools building fell beause of a big wind which is called the tropical cyclone and it got fixed.
    Again in 2017 the school fell and it was a big mess, the pictures are in the Gallery page. But it got fixed, altough it took a month or two for it to get fixed, but eventually it was fixed and the learners could go to school again.
